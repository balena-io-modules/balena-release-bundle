        Note that an API token is currently required for creating release

        bundles since it is used to authorize pulls from the registry.


        This commit also moves release manifest validation to separate functions
        for unit testing.


        This commit also removes the API call mocks and focuses the unit tests

        on release manifest validation.

    - subject: Moves nock setup to a function that runs before each test.
      hash: 45fb931ba9a5d0dc45f673e8933d1cfe59a7aac7
      body: >
        This change de-duplicates the logic for setting up the nocks for each

        test.  The mock definition files are now referenced based on the title
        of

        the test. This change makes it easier to add more tests or update

        existing ones in the future.


        This change also makes the tests reference use the nock definitions as

        reference for the application and release IDs.
